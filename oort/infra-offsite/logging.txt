Topic: logging system in Urbit
Date: 2022 Mar 01
Location: Mexico City
Context: discussion between Bren, Joshin, Peter, and Ted
Notes: 
- Urbit needs to produce detailed log files in addition to human-friendly (ish)
  console output.
- Any logging system that we build and/or adopt should be simple and use an
  easily parsable log format. 
- Contorting our needs to fit some existing service should be avoided.
- First step: adapt logging macro that writes to the console and also optionally
  a log file provided at the command line
  - Similar to u3l_log() but using file descriptors instead of file streams
    (i.e. FILE*)
  - Add metadata (pier, timestamp, event number, etc.) to log file but exclude
    from console
