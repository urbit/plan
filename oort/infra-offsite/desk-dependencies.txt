# big desks & little desks

big desk: current local desk behavior

little desk:
- do not care whether it compiles or not
- current foreign desk/mirror behavior (also past revisions of local)
- don't fill in the ankh
- don't respond to non-.hoon %x requests
  - or maybe just give back %noun

can toggle between big and little on demand, for example for kelvin upgrade

source desks are little desks, let you also save uncompiling versions of source
"build desks" fuse the source desk with its dependencies, resulting in a big desk

maybe a property of revisions instead of full desks?
easier to toggle, lets you make this referentially transparent
tbd

encourage distributing via source desks, works well with remote scry etc
but distributing the build desk remains an option

a big desk is just a desk
a little desk is a disc

ergonomic problem though: edit files across multiple desks
-> if you write into a build desk, the write looks through the list of dependencies, and writes to the last that has the file (if it's a local desk, just complain if it's not)
