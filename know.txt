/nigh is for projects which are either being actively worked on, planned
"next" for someone, or which have a deadline.

/near is for projects which have been decided are a good idea, but
nobody has scheduled time for it.

/dare is for speculative projects.  These are often incomplete and may
be incompatible with each other.  Presence in this directory does not
indicate endorsement or any plan to implement.

/yore is for past musings, miscellaneous writeups, or scrapped proposals
that may have valuable or enlightening material.


Bugs should not be tracked in this repo.

Everything should be a text document, with a .txt extension.  This means
it *must* look nice in an editor with no automatic word wrap; use the
normal conventions.  Paragraphs should generally be wrapped to 72
characters.  Try to note the @p of the author(s) at the top of the file
so the reader knows who to follow up with.

In general, each project should get one text file.  Use your judgment to
define project boundaries, but don't split up a file just because it's
big; it's easier to navigate a large file than to look through several
files.

You may commit directly to master; be bold.  Pull requests are not
necessary, but you're welcome to use them as a way to solicit
discussion.  If you have a half-done writeup that it's not worth having
other people review, still commit it!  You may note at the top that it's
in a half-baked state.

Never rebase or otherwise `push -f` master.
