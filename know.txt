## form

each directory should have a `know.txt` describing acceptable subject matter and
composition. as a rule, bugs should not be tracked in this repo.

`nigh/` `near/` and `dare/` should be considered project proposals and held to a
high standard, relative to their importance. `yore/` is mostly for past musings,
miscellaneous writeups, or scrapped proposals that may have valuable or
enlightening material.
